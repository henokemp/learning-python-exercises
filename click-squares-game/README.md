### Click Squares Game

The general idea behind this game is to have the player click one out of four squares while it changed it's colour to red. The squares change their colours after a randomly set amount of time. Once the player successfully clicked on a square while it's red, they get a point. 

### Planned Development (04.07.2020, 09:30)

* In a first step create the window and the four squares, 1 red and 3 black. 
* Get them to change colour randomly after a certain amount of time. 
* Introduce clickability of only the red square and connect it with the scoreboard. 
* (maybe get the squares to move)
